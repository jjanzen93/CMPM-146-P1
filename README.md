# CMPM-146-P1, An A* Pathfinding Algorithm developed by Jack Janzen and Andrew Wong

nm_pathfinder contains the completed find_path function along with some helper functions, find_ends, find_detail_point, and reconstruct_path.

Andrew Wong assembled the BFS search as a starting point, as well as figuring out detail points so that the lines drawn are legal.

Jack Janzen converted to a bidirectional A* pathfinding algorithm and moved some calculations and pieces of the algorithms into helper functions, like identifying the source boxes or finding the detail points.
